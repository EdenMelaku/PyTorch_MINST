# PyTorch_MNIST

Pytorch implemtation for mnist dataset 
## PyTorch
PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library for Python, based on Torch,used for applications such as natural language processing.It is primarily developed by Facebook's artificial-intelligence research group,
and Uber's "Pyro" software for probabilistic programming is built on it.

PyTorch provides two high-level features:

    Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
    Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autodiff system

## Data Set
### Mnist Data

The MNIST dataset is one of the most common datasets used for image classification and accessible from many different sources. 
The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 
testing images taken from American Census Bureau employees and American high school students see http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
